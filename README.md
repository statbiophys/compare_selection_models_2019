=== Reproduce Plots ===

In order to reproduce the plots you need to unzip the files input.zip and vampire-emerson.zip.

1) Sample data.

To sample the data for all figures, run sample_data.py

2) Infer the models.

To infer the model for fig1, run fig1_infer.py

To infer the model for fig2, run fig2_infer.py

3) Plot the results.

To recreate Fig 1, run fig1_plot.py

To recreate Fig 2a run fig2a_plot.py

To recreate Fig 2b, run fig2b_evaluate.py (in the vampire environment) and then fig2b_plot.py

=== Requisites ===

- olga
- tensorflow
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- matplotlib
